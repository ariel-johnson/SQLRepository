# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project
This repository is comprised of my SQL queries that I created through pgAdmin4(PostgreSQL) to provide insights to a hypothetical streaming service called "Rockbuster Stealth." I have also included my powerpoint presentation including a link to my Tableau report for this project.
