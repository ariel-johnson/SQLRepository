This query shows how I used the "inner join" and "on" functions to join the country column with the address ID and city ID to the country ID column since these were the key columns. 
Then I used the "group by", "order by", "descending", and "limit" functions to group the top 10 countries from highest to lowest customer count.
The query:
SELECT D.country, COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY COUNT (customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10
